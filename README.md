# image-colorization
This project focuses on using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to automatically colorize grayscale images, transforming black-and-white images into vibrant, lifelike color versions. The goal is to develop a deep learning model capable of learning the complex relationship between grayscale intensities and their corresponding colors.
